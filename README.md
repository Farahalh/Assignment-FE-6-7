Exercise 6: HTML - Skeleton for a Movie

NOTE: The result of the exercise must be shown to the teacher and approved before it can be considered completed. To be presented along with exercise 7.

HTML
To be able to build web-based applications, we must first learn how to structure and design a simple webpage. After all, webpages are what the upcoming applications will function on and be displayed on. Today, however, we will not write any functionality, but only create the appearance of a webpage.

HTML5
A webpage is constructed using HTML5, which is a markup language similar to XML. It is based on tags, and below you can find a list of those that will be needed today, as well as a link to most other tags and how they are used:

```html
<html> Declares that everything within the tag will be HTML (root node)
<head> Declares the beginning and end of the document's head (information)
<title> Document title, this tag is placed in <head>
<meta> Metadata, this tag is also placed in <head>
<link> Link to another document, usually .js (JavaScript) or .css (stylesheet)
<body> Declares the beginning and end of the document's body, what is displayed in the browser
<h1-6> Various headings
<header> Document header
<footer> Document footer
<a> A hyperlink
<img> An image
<iframe> Inline frame to embed another document, such as a YouTube video.
```

You can find the list of the remaining tags and descriptions at:

HTML5 Task
You have been tasked by the Film Company FS to create a promotional webpage for a currently showing movie. To do this, you first need to structure the page into different sections. These sections should be as follows:

- Header for the page
- Space for information on the page
- Space for video on the page
- A list of links relevant to the movie
- Footer on the page

Once you have created this HTML structure, the following is expected:

- The header contains a logo or image representation of the movie's title.
- The text area contains a brief snippet of information about when the movie is premiering, the director, actors, and a short description of the movie.
- The video area displays a trailer for the movie via YouTube (feel free to use YouTube's embed code under the "share" -> "embed" button).
- Important links are placed at the bottom of the page just before the footer.
- The footer should identify you as the webmaster and mention that the project is from FS.

NOTE: In this submission, you should only write HTML. CSS, etc., will be covered in later exercises. It might not look very appealing, but that's not the focus right now. You don't need to use Visual Studio for this exercise, although it's possible. Any text editor works fine. Sublime or Notepad++ are two convenient options that provide highlighting and other tools.

Before submission: Run your HTML through the validator: [https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload)

Good luck!

Exercise 7: CSS - Adding Some Style to the Skeleton

NOTE: The result of this exercise must be shown to the teacher and approved before it can be considered completed.

In the previous task, you created an HTML skeleton that might not have looked very nice or impressive. Today, you will use CSS to style the skeleton so that it resembles a webpage that someone would want to visit. However, don't be disappointed if it doesn't look fantastic; it's still a very simple page. Use the knowledge you have gained from the video material to improve the appearance.

The following requests are in place:

- Text and video content should be centered.
- The foreground and background colors should be relevant to the movie (look at posters).
- The list of links should be horizontal.
- The footer should be 50px tall and have a different background color than the rest of the page.

Feel free to take this opportunity to experiment a bit with CSS. The requests are a minimum, not a maximum. Try to make the page look pleasant.
